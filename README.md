# Pigeo

This game was built using React.

## Background

I wanted to see how far I would get creating a game with React. 

I never ended up finishing it, but I realised that it isn't too difficult to make a 2D game using sprites and my own make-shift game engine. Of course using a real game engine like Unity or Unreal would take away all of the headaches with trying to write a game engine. It took me about 3 days to get this up and running, was a fun experience. Next time though, I'll probably be using Unity unless it's a word-based game or something similar that doesn't require much artwork or animation.
